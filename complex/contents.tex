\title{Differential forms for complex analysis}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

This set of notes is intended as a supplementary ``crash course'' in differential forms and their applications to a first complex analysis class.
It contains the following files:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{forms}: \textbf{A crash course in differential forms}.
  This would be suitable for use either as part of a review of multivariable calculus at the beginning of a complex analysis class, or immediately prior to handing out \texttt{complex-differentials}.
\item \texttt{complex-differentials}: \textbf{Complex differential forms}.
  This is intended to be read at about the same time that the Cauchy--Riemann equations and the notion of complex differentiability are introduced.
\item \texttt{complex-integrals}: \textbf{Complex integration of differential forms}.
  This is intended to be read at about the same time as complex line integrals are introduced and the closed curve theorem is proven.
\end{enumerate}
