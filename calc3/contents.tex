\chapter{Differential forms for multivariable calculus}

This set of notes is intended as a supplement to a standard course in multivariable calculus, to explain differential forms and how they unify the various theorems of vector calculus.
It contains the following chapters (each in a separate file):
\begin{itemize}
\item \cref{cha:1dforms} (\texttt{1dforms}): \textbf{Differential forms in one dimension}.
\end{itemize}
