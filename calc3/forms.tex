\title{On differential forms}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

In your previous calculus classes, you may or may not have encountered \emph{differential forms} by name.
However, you've certainly met them, even if you didn't realize it.
When you write
\[ \int_{x=a}^b f(x) \,\dx \]
the thing being integrated, ``$f(x) \,\dx$'', is a differential form.

You may have been told that the ``$\dx$'' is simply a notation that indicates which variable we're integrating, but this is a lie.
In multivariable calculus, we can no longer maintain this fiction: we have to treat differential forms as honest objects.
Fortunately, we also have two advantages over one-variable calculus in understanding differential forms: we have \emph{vectors} at our disposal; and some things are actually \emph{less} confusing in more dimensions because there are fewer coincidences to get confused by.

\section{Differential forms}
\label{sec:differential-forms}

If $\dx$ isn't just a notation indicating the integration variable, what is it?
If you encountered differentials in one-variable calculus, you may have been told that $\dx$ is a small change in $x$ (sometimes denoted $\Delta x$), or even an ``infinitesimal'' change in $x$.
These are not wrong, but with vectors we can give a better definition.

\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{differential 1-form} is a function whose input is a point $\pt{x}$ \emph{and} a vector based at $\pt{x}$.
  We denote the vector by $\dpx$.
\end{defn}

In $n$ dimensions, the point $\pt{x}$ has $n$ coordinates, as does the vector $\dpx$.
As usual, in 2 or 3 dimensions we denote the coordinates of $\pt{x}$ by $\ptc{x,y}$ or $\ptc{x,y,z}$.
Similarly, we denote the coordinates of $\dpx$ by $\vcc{\dx,\dy}$ or $\vcc{\dx,\dy,\dz}$.
We can then describe a differential form by a formula involving these coordinates $x,y,z,\dx,\dy,\dz$.

\begin{egs}
  The following are all differential 1-forms:
  \begin{gather*}
    x^2 \,\dx + 2xy \, \dy\\
    \half({x-z}) \,\dx - 4\, \dy + e^y \,\dz\\
    1 + \dx + \half \dx^2 + \third \dx^3\\
    \sin(x + \dx) - \sin(x)\\
    \sqrt{\dx^2+\dy^2}
  \end{gather*}
\end{egs}

Note that although $\dx$ is two letters, we regard it as one symbol standing for one variable.
In particular, an expression such as $\dx^2$ means $(\dx)^2$, not $\dd(x^2)$.
(We will give a different meaning to $\dd(x^2)$ in \cref{sec:differentials}.)

Of these examples, the first two are special.

\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{linear} differential 1-form is one defined by an expression of the form
  \[ f(\pt{x}) \, \dx + g(\pt{x}) \, \dy + h(\pt{x}) \, \dz. \]
  Here $f$, $g$, and $h$ are functions of the point $\pt{x}$ only, and each of them is multiplied by one of the coordinates of $\dpx$.
\end{defn}

Most mathematicians only use the term ``differential 1-form'' for linear ones.
However, the more general ones are quite useful.

It is helpful to think of the coordinates $\dx$, $\dy$, and $\dz$ as small changes in the value of $x$.
For instance, if $x=3$, then a possible small change would be $\dx = 0.001$.
In this case, a differential form such as $\dx^2$ is an \emph{even smaller} change, since $\dx^2 = 0.000001$.
It is useful to classify the \emph{order} of a differential form as follows.

\begin{defn}
  Let $k$ be an integer $\ge 0$.
  A differential 1-form $\omega$ is \textbf{$k\th$ order} at a point $\pt{x}$ if
  \[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\omega(\pt{x},h\,\dd\pt{x})}{h^{k-1}} = 0 \]
  for all $\dd\pt{x}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  Any linear differential 1-form is first order at every point.
  For instance, if $\omega(\pt{x},\dd\pt{x}) = f(\pt{x}) \, \dx$, then
  \[ \frac{\omega(\pt{x},h\,\dd\pt{x})}{h^0} = f(\pt{x}) \, h\, \dx,\]
  which goes to zero as $h\to 0$ (for fixed $\pt{x}$ and $\dd\pt{x}$).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  A differential 1-form not depending on $\dd\pt{x}$ (that is, essentially an ordinary function of $\pt{x}$) is zeroth order at every point.
  Since $\frac{1}{h^{-1}} = h$, we have
  \[\frac{\omega(\pt{x},h\,\dd\pt{x})}{h^{k-1}} = h \,\omega(\pt{x}),\]
  which goes to zero as $h\to 0$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  The differential form $\dx^2$ is second order at any point.
  We have
  \[ \frac{\omega(\pt{x},h\,\dd\pt{x})}{h^1} = \frac{(h\,\dx)^2}{h} = \frac{h^2 \, \dx^2}{h} = h \,\dx^2 \]
  which goes to zero as $h\to 0$.
\end{eg}

In general, a polynomial has the order of the lowest exponent of $\dx$ appearing in any of its terms.
Thus, $x^3\, \dx^2 + \dx^3 - 2x \,\dx^4$ is second order at every point.

\begin{rmk}
  If a form is $k\th$ order, then it is also $(k-1)\st$ order; thus any second order form is also first order and zeroth order, and so on.
  However, a $k\th$ order form is not generally also $(k+1)\st$ order.
  We usually emphasize the greatest order that a form has; e.g.\ we almost always care most that $\dx^2$ is second order, even though it is also first and zeroth order.
\end{rmk}

\begin{eg}
  A differential form can have a higher order at some points than others.
  For instance, the form $x \,\dx + \dx^2$ is first-order everywhere, but at the point $x=0$ it becomes $0\, dx + \dx^2 = \dx^2$, which is second order.
\end{eg}


\section{Differentials}
\label{sec:differentials}

In one-variable calculus, you may have encountered the differential of a function.
Namely, if $f$ is a function of one variable $x$, then its differential is
\begin{equation}
  \df = f'(x) \, \dx\label{eq:onevariable-differential}
\end{equation}
where $f'$ is the \emph{derivative} of $f$.
This can be interpreted in terms of the graph of the function $f$\dots

\Cref{eq:onevariable-differential} defines the \emph{differential} of $f$ in terms of the \emph{derivative} of $f$.
However, in multivariable calculus, it is more appropriate to do things in the other order, defining the differential first.
Linear approximation\dots

\begin{defn}
  If $f$ is a function of a point $\pt{x}$, then its \textbf{differential} is a linear differential 1-form $\df$ such that
  \[ f(\pt{x} + \dd\pt{x}) - f(\pt{x}) - \df \]
  is second order at $\pt{x}$.
  If such a form $\df$ exists, we say that $f$ is \textbf{differentiable} at $\pt{x}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  Let $f(x) = x^2$, an ordinary one-variable function.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    f(x + \dx) - f(x) &= (x+\dx)^2 - x^2\\
    &= x^2 + 2 x \, \dx + \dx^2 - x^2\\
    &= 2x \, \dx + \dx ^2.
  \end{align*}
  What differential form $\dd f$ can we subtract from this to make it second order?
  Recalling the rule for orders of polynomials, we may think of subtracting $2x \, \dx$, leaving the second-order term $\dx^2$:
  \[ f(x + \dx) - f(x) - 2x \, \dx \;=\; \dx^2. \]
  Thus, we have $\dd(x^2) = 2 x \, \dx$.
  Of course, this is the same result that we would have gotten from \cref{eq:onevariable-differential}.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Let $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - xy$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    f(x+\dx,y+\dy) - f(x,y)
    &= (x+\dx)^2 + 2(y+\dy)^2 - (x+\dx)(y+\dy) - x^2 - 2y^2 + xy\\
    &= x^2 + 2 x \, dx + \dx^2 + 2y^2 + 4y\,dy + 2\dy^2\\
    & \hspace{2cm} - x^2 - x \, \dy - y \, dx - \dx \dy - x^2 - 2y^2 + xy\\
    &= 2x\,dx + 4y\,\dy - x\,\dy - y\,\dx + \dx^2 + 2\dy^2 - \dx\,\dy\\
    &= (2x-y)\,dx + (4y-x)\,\dy + (\dx^2 + 2\dy^2 - \dx\,\dy)
  \end{align*}
  In the last line we have separated this into a linear form plus one of second order.
  Thus, we have
  \[ \dd(x^2 + 2y^2 - xy) = (2x-y)\,dx + (4y-x)\,\dy .\]
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Consider $f(x) = \sin x$.
  Using the sum identity for sine, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \sin(x+\dx) - \sin (x)
    &= \sin x \cos \dx + \sin \dx \cos x - \sin x\\
    &= \cos x \sin \dx + \sin x (\cos \dx - 1).
  \end{align*}
  The usual way to proceed from here is to recall the limits
  \[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sin h}{h} = 1 \qquad\text{and}\qquad
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\cos h - 1}{h} = 0 \]
  The second one implies that
  \[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\cos (h\,\dx) - 1}{h} = 0 \]
  and therefore the form $\cos \dx - 1$ is second-order.
  Similarly, the first one implies that
  \[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sin (h\, \dx) - h \, \dx}{h} = 0 \]
  and therefore the form $\sin \dx - \dx$ is second-order.
  These properties are unchanged when multiplying by ordinary functions such as $\cos x$ and $\sin x$, so we have
  \begin{align*}
    \sin(x+\dx) - \sin (x)
    &= \cos x \sin \dx + \sin x (\cos \dx - 1)\\
    &= \cos x (\dx  + \sin \dx - \dx) + \sin x (\cos \dx - 1)\\
    &= \cos x \,\dx + \cos x (\sin \dx - \dx) + \sin x (\cos \dx - 1)
  \end{align*}
  which is written as the linear form $\cos x \,\dx$ plus a second-order one.
  Thus, $\dd(\sin x) = \cos x \,\dx$.
\end{eg}

All the usual derivative rules of one-variable calculus can be derived from this definition as well.\dots

\section{Derivatives}
\label{sec:derivatives}

We can now define the \emph{derivative} in terms of the \emph{differential}.
Note that in one dimension, a linear differential 1-form must be of the form
\[ g(x) \,\dx \]
for some function $g$.
In particular, if $f$ is a differentiable function, then $\dd f = g(x) \, \dx$ for some function $g$, which we call the \emph{derivative} of $f$ and denote by $f'$.
In other words,
\[ f'(x) = \frac{\dd f}{\dx}, \]
which is a notation that you have probably seen before.
The point is that now, we have given separate meanings to $\dx$ and $\dd f$, and \emph{defined} $f'(x)$ to be their quotient.
